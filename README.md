# tweet-analyzer
Simple tools written in Python for extracting big data related to tweets. Includes tokenizer, data visualization, and other tools for preparing data analysis and NLP algorithms. 

It also includes a tool for exporting the collected data as csv file for the purpose of making data manipulation simpler. I have included example charts and graphs in this respository as well as some using Tableau which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/uriel.ulloa#!/vizhome/twitter-test/Sheet2

You can find the required data using this link: http://lst.science.ru.nl/~proycon/twitterdata.zip

*Requires mathplotlib and numpy for running data visualization tools. Pandas required for reading cvs files. Run in Python3 to avoid issues.
